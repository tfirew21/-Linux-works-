WHILE LOOP=#!/bin/sh

a=10

until [ $a -lt 10 ]
do
   echo $a
   a=`expr $a + 1`
done
This loop continues forever because a is always greater than or equal to 10 and it is never less than 10.
The break Statement
The break statement is used to terminate the execution of the entire loop, after completing the execution of all of the lines of code up to the break statement. 
Here is a simple example which shows that loop terminates as soon as a becomes 5 −

#!/bin/sh

a=0

while [ $a -lt 10 ]
do
   echo $a
   if [ $a -eq 5 ]
   then
      break
   fi
   a=`expr $a + 1`
   DONE
   Upon execution, you will receive the following result −

0
1
2
3
4
5
